This directory contains a collection of example scripts.  There is one
test_*.py script for each tool in Pizza.py.  These illustrate how to
use the tool.  The small data sets used by these scripts are in the
files sub-directly.

A test_*.py script can be run by launching Pizza.py from this
directory, e.g.

% pizza.py -f test_animate.py           from the shell
> @run test_animtate.py                 from Pizza.py

The other scripts in this directory perform specific tasks.  Read the
comments at the top of the script file for an explanation.  Most of
these scripts require a data set to operate on, which is not provided.
These scripts are included simply to illustrate how a particular task
can be done in Pizza.py.

These scripts create output and temporary files as they operate.
These are all named tmp*.  Pizza.py does not clean up all the
temporary files, since they are sometimes useful to look at for
debugging or other purposes.

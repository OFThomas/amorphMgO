# 3 variables used by Pizza.py
# to use TOOLS or SCRIPTS, edit and uncomment the line
# to use EXCLUDE, add to the existing list

# TOOLS = list of extra directories that contain Pizza.py tools
#   Pizza.py will load all *.py files as tools from TOOLS dirs, then pizza/src
#   this ordering means your tool can override a Pizza.py tool of the same name
# SCRIPTS = list of extra directories that contain Pizza.py scripts
#   Pizza.py will look in working dir, SCRIPTS dirs, then pizza/scripts
#   this ordering means your script can override a Pizza.py script of same name
# EXCLUDE = Python files to NOT load as tools when Pizza.py starts
#   typically done for auxiliary Python files that are not tools
#   any non-tool Python files from your TOOLS dirs should be added to list

#PIZZA_TOOLS = ["~/mystuff/new_pizza_tools"]
#PIZZA_SCRIPTS = ["~/mystuff/new_pizza_scripts"]
PIZZA_EXCLUDE = ["pizza", "DEFAULTS", "vizinfo"]

# Pathname for programs executed by various Pizza.py tools

# if you don't use a tool, it's settings can be ignored
# the default values are program names with no path
# to use a default value, the executable must therefore be in your path
# to change a default, edit and uncomment the PIZZA variable line

pair tool :h3

[Purpose:]

Compute LAMMPS pairwise energies.

[Description:]

The pair tool computes a pairwise energy between 2 particles using a
LAMMPS molecular dynamics force field.  Thus it can be used in an
analysis script to compute energies between groups of atoms from a
LAMMPS snapshot file.

The pair constructor specifies the force field style.  Only some of
the LAMMPS pair styles are currently included in this tool, but new
styles can easily be added.  Code from the LAMMPS pair*.cpp file needs
to be re-coded in Python to make this work.

The coeff() method reads the pairwise coefficients for the force field
from a data file object (see the "data"_data.html tool).  The init()
method does pre-computations for the force field parameters needed by
the single() method which does a pairwise computation between two
atoms of type = itype,jtype separated by a squared distance rsq.  The
arguments for init() and single() can be different for a particular
force field style.  When you write the init() and single() methods for
a new style, you can define what arguments are needed.

[Usage:]

p = pair("lj/charmm/coul/charmm")   create pair object for specific pair style :pre

  available styles: lj/cut, lj/cut/coul/cut, lj/charmm/coul/charmm :pre

p.coeff(d)			    extract pairwise coeffs from data object
p.init(cut1,cut2,...)		    setup based on coeffs and cutoffs :pre

  init args are specific to pair style:
    lj/cut = cutlj
    lj/cut/coul/cut = cutlj,cut_coul (cut_coul optional)
    lj/charmm/coul/charmm = cutlj_inner,cutlj,cutcoul_inner,cut_coul
      (last 2 optional) :pre

e_vdwl,e_coul = p.single(rsq,itype,jtype,q1,q2,...)   compute LJ/Coul energy :pre

  pairwise energy between 2 atoms at distance rsq with their attributes
  args are specific to pair style:
    lj/cut = rsq,itype,jtype
    lj/cut/coul/cut = rsq,itype,jtype,q1,q2
    lj/charmm/coul/charmm = rsq,itype,jtype,q1,q2 :pre

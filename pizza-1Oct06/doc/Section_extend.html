<H3>6. Extending Pizza.py 
</H3>
<P>Pizza.py can easily be extended in several ways:
</P>
<OL><LI>fix a bug
<LI>make a tool method faster or cleaner
<LI>add a new method or setting to a tool
<LI>add a new tool
<LI>add a generically useful script to the scripts dir
<LI>add a script that does something interesting to the examples dir
<LI>send a picture or movie you made with Pizza.py for the <A HREF = "http://www.cs.sandia.gov/~sjplimp/pizza.html">WWW page</A>. 
</OL>
<P>You might be able to do (2) because you're better with Python than we
are!  Note that generally, we've opted for simplicity versus speed in
writing the tools, unless the operation is very costly.  An example of
something I'd like to speed up is the reading of large dump files in
dump.py.
</P>
<P>Some of the ideas we've had for (3), but haven't gotten around to, are
listed at the top of the src/*.py files as ToDo items.
</P>
<P>If you think your addition will be useful to other Pizza.py users,
email it to sjplimp@sandia.gov and it can be added to the distribution
with an attribution to you, both in the source code and on the
<A HREF = "http://www.cs.sandia.gov/~sjplimp/pizza/thanks.html">Pizza.py WWW site</A>.
</P>


<HR>

<P>Here are ideas to consider when creating new Pizza.py tools or
scripts:
</P>
<P>(1) For tools, your *.py file should contain a Python class with the
same name as the *.py file since it will be imported into Pizza.py
with a statement like
</P>
<PRE>from dump import dump 
</PRE>
<P>(2) Your scripts can use methods from Pizza.py classes to make data
analysis easier.  E.g. scripts can be written that use the dump tool
to read dump files, then use the iterator calls and vecs() method from
dump.py to loop over snapshots and extract lists of particles for
further computation.  See the scripts and examples directories for
examples of this.
</P>
<P>(3) To flag an error in your script or tool and exit back to the
Pizza.py prompt, use a line like:
</P>
<PRE>raise StandardError,"error message" 
</PRE>
<P>(4) Document your tool be defining the "oneline" and "docstr"
variables at the top of the file.  This is what will be printed when
you type "?  dump", for example.
</P>
<P>(5) If you intend your tool to interact with other Pizza.py tools, you
should follow the Pizza.py philosophy of having objects be passed as
arguments to the tool methods.  If you're creating a tool that is
similar to an existing tool, but a different flavor (e.g. wrapping
another plotting package in addition to MatLab or GnuPlot), then try
to make the interface similar to the others so all the related tools
can be used interchangeably.
</P>
<P>(6) From the Pizza.py perspective, the difference between a script and
a tool is as follows.  A script typically does a specific operation
(with or without arguments).  E.g. process a dump file and compute a
quantity.  A tool version of the same operation would allow it to
store internal state and persist, or to be packaged in a way that
other tools or scripts can create instances of it and call its
methods.  From the Python perspective the code for the 2 cases may not
look very different.  The tool version might just be some Python
variables and methods stuck inside a Python class, which is what a
Pizza.py tool basically is.
</P>
<P>(7) The various Pizza.py tools are mostly related to the "LAMMPS"
molecular dynamics or <A HREF = "http://www.cs.sandia.gov/~sjplimp/chemcell.html">ChemCell</A> cell simulator packages.  But
of course you can write Pizza.py tools that have nothing to do with
LAMMPS or ChemCell.  If you think they will still be of general
interest to Pizza.py users, you can send them to us to include in the
Pizza.py distribution.  Or you can keep the top-level pizza.py file,
throw away the LAMMPS and ChemCell tool files, build your own toolkit
for whatever application you wish, and use or even distribute it
yourself.  That's the open-source philosophy.
</P>

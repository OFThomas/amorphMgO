animate tool :h3

[Purpose:]

Animate a series of image files.

[Description:]

The animate tool displays a GUI to view and animate a series of image
files.

The animate constructor creates the GUI.  The animation can be
controlled by the GUI widgets or by invoking the tool methods: play(),
stop(), next(), etc.  The frame slider can be dragged to view a
desired frame.

Image files can be in any format (PNG, GIF, BMP, etc) recognized by
the Python Image Library (PIL) installed in your Python.  Various
Pizza.py visualization tools (raster, rasmol, etc) create such image
files.  If a particular image format fails to load, your PIL
installation was linked without support for that format.  Rebuild PIL,
and follow its install instructions.

[Usage:]

a = animate("image*.png")     create GUI to animate set of image files :pre

Actions (same as GUI widgets): :pre

a.first()		      go to first frame
a.prev()                      go to previous frame
a.back()                      play backwards from current frame to start
a.stop()         	      stop on current frame		
a.play()                      play from current frame to end
a.next()		      go to next frame
a.last()		      go to last frame :pre

a.frame(31)    	              set frame slider
a.delay(0.4)     	      set delay slider :pre

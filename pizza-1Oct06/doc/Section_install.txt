2. Installing Pizza.py :h3

Unpack the Pizza.py distribution by typing the following:

gunzip pizza.tar.gz
tar xvf pizza.tar :pre

The Pizza.py main directory should then contain the following
directories:

README:			   initial instructions
LICENSE:		   the GNU open-source license
doc:			   HTML documentation for Pizza.py
examples:		   scripts and data sets that exercise Pizza.py tools
scripts:		   various Pizza.py script files
src:			   source code for Pizza.py and its tools :tb(s=:)

Because Python is an interpreted language, there is no need to compile
or "make" Pizza.py.  You run Pizza.py by executing the src/pizza.py
file directly, as described below.  However there are 3 issues to
consider: (a) you must have Python installed on your machine, (b) some
Pizza.py tools require your Python to be extended with additional
Python packages, and (c) some Pizza.py tools are wrappers on other
software which needs to be available on your system.

If you don't plan to use a particular Pizza.py tool, you don't need to
install additional Python packages or other software it requires.

2.1 "Installing Python"_#2_1
2.2 "Running Pizza.py"_#2_2
2.3 "Setting up the DEFAULTS.py file"_#2_3
2.4 "Installing additional Python packages"_#2_4
2.5 "Installing other software"_#2_5 :all(b)

Note that we cannot provide help on installing the various software
packages described here.  If you have problems, you'll need to talk to
a local expert who can help you with your machine.  If you find that
instructions on this page are incorrect or incomplete or you can
provide a better description of the install procedure, please send an
email to sjplimp@sandia.gov.

Installing Python :h4,link(2_1)

Python is open-source software available for Unix, Macintosh, and
Windows machines.  If you have a Linux box or Mac it is probably
already installed.  If the python executable is in your path, typing
"python" should give you a Python prompt ">>>" and tell you what
version you are running.  Version 2.3 or 2.4 is sufficiently current
to run Pizza.py, though older versions may work as well.

If Python is not installed on your machine, go to
"www.python.org"_http://www.python.org to download a binary or
source-code version and then build and/or install it.

:line

Running Pizza.py :h4,link(2_2)

Typically Pizza.py should be run from the directory where your LAMMPS
or other data files are.  Like any Python program, Pizza.py can be run
in one of 2 ways, by typing either

python -i ~/pizza/src/pizza.py
~/pizza/src/pizza.py :pre

where the last argument is the full pathname of the pizza.py file.

The -i switch leaves Python in interactive mode (instead of exiting)
after the pizza.py script is run.  In the 2nd case, if the src dir is
in your path, just pizza.py could be typed.  For the 2nd case, you
must also set src/pizza.py to be an executable file (chmod +x
pizza.py) and edit the 1st line of pizza.py to reflect where Python
lives on your system (find it by typing "which python"), e.g.

#!/usr/local/bin/python -i

Putting a definition like one of the following in your .cshrc file (or
equivalent syntax for other Unix shell start-up files) will let you
simply type "pizza" at the command-line to start Pizza.py.

alias pizza python -i ~/pizza/src/pizza.py
alias pizza ~/pizza/src/pizza.py

Pizza.py accepts several command-line options; they are described in
"this section"_Section_basics.html of the documentation.

When Pizza.py starts, it reads a few values from the src/DEFAULTS.py
file (described below) and imports the *.py files from the src
directory as Python modules.  These are the Pizza.py tools.  Error
messages will be printed if your Python has not been extended with a
Python package that a tool requires.  If you don't plan to use the
tool you can ignore the message, or exclude that tool via a
command-line switch.

Once all tools have been loaded and any initial scripts and commands
have been run (via command-line arguments) you should see the Pizza.py
">" prompt.  From this point on, everything you type is a Python
command.  Python interprets what you type, operates on your data, and
produces output or error messages, just as if you were typing in
response to Python's interactive prompt ">>>".

You can also type special commands that have been added to the Python
interpreter by Pizza.py or commands that invoke Pizza.py tools.  More
details about these options are explained in "this
section"_Section_basics.html of the documentation.

As with Python, type Ctrl-D to exit Pizza.py at any time.

:line

Setting up the DEFAULTS.py file :h4,link(2_3)

When Pizza.py starts it reads 3 values from the src/DEFAULTS.py file:

PIZZA_TOOLS: directories that contain additional Pizza.py tools
PIZZA_SCRIPTS: directories that contain additional Pizza.py scripts
PIZZA_EXCLUDE: Python files that are not loaded, since they are not tools :tb(s=:)

These are designed to allow users to augment Pizza.py with their own
tools and scripts, which need not be stored in the directories of the
Pizza.py pacakge.  Follow the instructions in the DEFAULTS.py file for
using these options.

The DEFAULTS.py files also contains various variables that specify the
name and path of programs that Pizza.py tools will execute on your
system.  In some cases the variables contain settings that are used by
these programs.  Read the comments in the DEFAULTS.py file for more
information.

The following table lists the keywords in the DEFAULTS.py, the program
or setting that will be used by default if the keyword line is
commented out, and the Pizza.py tools that use the keyword.  If the
program is not in your path or you wish to use an alternate program or
setting, you must edit the DEFAULTS.py file accordingly.  If you don't
plan to use any tool that needs the keyword, you can ignore its
setting.

Keyword: Default Value: Purpose: Tools that Use it
DISPLAY: display: display image files (ImageMagick): rasmol, raster, svg
CONVERT: convert: convert image files (ImageMagick): image
MONTAGE: montage: montage image files (ImageMagick): image
GNUPLOT: gnuplot: Gnu Plotting package: gnu
GNUTERM: x11: GnuPlot terminal: gnu
GUNZIP: gunzip: unzip a compressed *.gz file: dump, log
LABEL3D: label3d: put a label on a Raster3D image: raster
MATLAB: matlab: MatLab numerical analysis & plotting package: matlab
RASMOL: rasmol: RasMol molecular vizualization package: rasmol
RENDER: render: Raster3D vizualization rendering engine: raster :tb(s=:)

:line

Installing additional Python packages :h4,link(2_4)

This is the list of extra Python packages various Pizza.py tools
require.  If a tool is not listed it requires no extra packages.
Instructions on where to find the Python extensions and how to install
them are listed below.

Package : Tools that Use it
Numeric : dump
PIL     : animate, gl, image
Pmw     : image
PyOpenGL: gl
readline: Pizza.py itself
Tkinter : animate, image, plotview :tb(s=:)

Numeric :h4

"Numeric"_numeric enables Python to process vectors and arrays of
numbers efficiently, both in memory and CPU speed.  It's an extremely
useful extension to have in your Python if you do any numerical work
on large data sets.  Note that Pizza.py uses the older (but still
popular) Numeric package, not the newer numarray package.

If Numeric is already installed in your Python, you should be able to
type the following without getting an error:

>>> import Numeric

Numeric can be downloaded from "this site"_numdown.  Version 23 or
newer is fine.  Once unpacked, you can type the following from the
Numeric directory to install it in your Python.

python setup.py install :pre

:link(numeric,http://numeric.scipy.org)
:link(numdown,http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=1369&package_id=1351)

PIL :h4

The PIL ("Python Imaging Library"_pil) allows Python to read image
files, manipulate them, and convert between several common image
formats.

:link(pil,http://www.pythonware.com/products/pil)

If PIL is already installed in your Python, you should be able to type
the following without getting an error:

>>> import Image,ImageTk

PIL can be downloaded from "this site"_pil.  Version 1.1.4 is fine.
Once the Imaging-1.1.4 tar file is unpacked, follow the instructions
to insure that PIL is linked to the correct libraries for image
formats you intend to use.  The actual installation can be done by
typing

python setup.py install :pre

Pmw :h4

Pmw ("Python mega-widgets"_pmw) is a common Tkinter extension that
provides a host of more powerful GUI widgets.

:link(pmw,http://pmw.sourceforge.net)

If Pmw is already installed in your Python, you should be able to type
the following without getting an error:

>>> import Pmw

Pmw can be downloaded from "this site"_pmw.  Version 1.2 is fine.  Pmw
is installed by placing its files in your Python's site-packages
directory.  This install text is from the Pmw distribution:

... assuming you have placed the tar file in the /tmp directory, you
can simply run the following commands:

cd /usr/lib/python2.2/site-packages
gunzip /tmp/Pmw.1.2.tar.gz (or gzip -d /tmp/Pmw.1.2.tar.gz)
tar xvf /tmp/Pmw.1.2.tar :pre

If you do not have write permission for these standard directories,
place the Pmw directory somewhere on your PYTHONPATH or sys.path. If
this is not possible, place the Pmw directory somewhere else and add
the parent directory to your PYTHONPATH or sys.path.

PyOpenGL :h4

The "PyOpenGL"_pyopengl package is a wrapper on the ubiquitous OpenGL
graphics library and allows a Python program to make graphics calls in
standard OpenGL syntax.  It also includes Togl (Tcl/Tk) support for
opening a Tk OpenGL widget, which Pizza.py uses.

:link(pyopengl,http://pyopengl.sourceforge.net)

If PyOpenGL is already installed in your Python, you should be able to
type the following without getting an error:

>>> import OpenGL

PyOpenGL can be downloaded from "this site"_pydown on SourceForge.
You want the latest PyOpenGL release (not OpenGLContext).  After you
have downloaded the needed files, you will want to read the PyOpenGL
"installation instructions"_pyinstall.  If you are installing from
source, you can hopefully type the following from the PyOpenGL
directory to install it in your Python, though in my experience it
doesn't always work transparently:

python setup.py install :pre

Note that running PyOpenGL requires your system have OpenGL, GLUT,
Tcl/Tk, PIL, and Numeric libraries already installed.  The GL and
Tck/Tk libraries are already in place on most Linux systems.

:link(pydown,http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=5988)
:link(pyinstall,http://pyopengl.sourceforge.net/documentation/installation.html)
readline :h4

Support for the "readline"_readline library is part of Python but is
not supported on all systems.  If it works in your Python, then
Pizza.py (and Python) prompts are more shell-like and should support
arrow keys, Emacs-style editing, command history, etc.  If you get an
error "No module named readline" when Pizza.py starts up, you can
ignore it, or comment out the line "import readline" in pizza.py.

If readline is already installed in your Python, you should be able to
type the following without getting an error:

>>> import readline :pre

The readline library can be downloaded from "this site"_readdown.
After building the library, I believe you then have to rebuild Python
for Python to work with it.

:link(readline,http://cnswww.cns.cwru.edu/~chet/readline/rltop.html)
:link(readdown,http://cnswww.cns.cwru.edu/~chet/readline/rltop.html#Availability)

Tkinter :h4

The Tkinter package is part of Python but is not always enabled when
Python is built.  If you can type the following without an error
message in your Python, then Tkinter is operational in your Python:

>>> import Tkinter
>>> Tkinter._test() :pre

If not, "this WWW page"_http://wiki.python.org/moin/TkInter explains
how to determine what your Python lacks and how to fix it.
Unfortunately these instructions are not 100% clear to me.  They also
typically require root privelege on your system.

Alternatively, you can install your own version of Python, insure that
Tkinter is enabled when you build it, and make the new Python your
default (i.e. put it first in your path, or point to it with an alias
or link).  This is what I did, but unfortunately, this is also a
non-trivial procedure.

If any Python afficionado understands a better way to enable Tkinter
or can explain it more clearly, I'd appreciate an email to
sjplimp@sandia.gov.

:line

Installing other software :h4,link(2_5)

Some Pizza.py tools invoke other software which must be installed on
your system for the tool to work.  This is an alphabetic list of the
needed software.  Except where noted, it is freely available for
download on the WWW.  The Pizza.py tools that use this software are
listed above in "this section"_#2_3.

ImageMagickk display, convert, montage commands :h4

Several Pizza.py tools display image files.  The ImageMagick "display"
program can be used for this purpose.  Likewise, the ImageMagick
"convert" and "montage" comands are used by the image tool.  The
ImageMagick toolkit can be downloaded from "this site"_imagemagick and
contains a variety of useful image conversion and manipulation
software.

:link(imagemagick,http://www.imagemagick.org/script/index.php)

GnuPlot :h4

The Pizza.py gnu tool is a wrapper on the open-source GnuPlot program.
GnuPlot can be downloaded from "this site"_gnuplot.

:link(gnuplot,http://www.gnuplot.info)

Gunzip :h4

Gunzip is invoked by Python to read compressed (*.gz) data and dump
files.  It is almost certainly on your Unix system (type "which
gunzip").  If not if can be downloaded from "this site"_gzip.

:link(gzip,http://www.gnu.org/software/gzip/gzip.html)

Label3d :h4

The Pizza.py tool raster uses the label3d and render programs from the
Raster3d visualization package to produce high-quality ray-traced
images.  See the description of "Render" below for information about
Raster3d.

MatLab :h4

The Pizza.py matlab tool is a wrapper on MatLab which is a widely-used
commercial numerical analysis package that also produces nice plots.
Further information is available at "the MathWorks WWW site"_matlab.
When MatLab is installed on your system and the appropriate
environment variables are set, the command "matlab" should launch the
program.

:link(matlab,http://www.mathworks.com)

RasMol :h4

The Pizza.py rasmol tool invokes the RasMol visualization package to
view molecular systems and produce nice images.  RasMol can be
downloaded from "this site"_rasmol, which is for the original
open-source version of RasMol, not the Protein Explorer derivative
version of RasMol.

:link(rasmol,http://www.openrasmol.org)

Note that when using RasMol on a Mac, you will need to launch X11
first (or run Pizza.py from an X11 xterm) to get RasMol to display
properly.

Render :h4

The Pizza.py tool raster uses the render and label3d programs from the
Raster3d visualization package to produce high-quality ray-traced
images.  Raster3d can be downloaded from "this site"_raster.

:link(raster,http://www.bmsc.washington.edu/raster3d/raster3d.html)

For Macs, Raster3d is available for download via "Fink"_fink as an
"unstable package"_unstable.

:link(fink,http://fink.sourceforge.net/pdb/package.php/raster3d)
:link(unstable,http://fink.sourceforge.net/faq/usage-fink.php?phpLang=en#unstable)

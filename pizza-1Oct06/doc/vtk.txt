vtk tool :h3

[Purpose:]

Convert LAMMPS snapshots to VTK format.

[Description:]

The vtk tool converts atom snapshots in a LAMMPS dump or data file to
the VTK format used by various visualization packages.

The vtk constructor takes an object that stores atom snapshots
("dump"_dump.html, "data"_data.html) as its first argument.
Optionally, a file prefix for the XYZ output files can also be
specified.  A ".xyz" suffix will be appended to all output files.  The
file prefix can also be specified by the file setting.

The one(), many(), and single() methods convert specific snapshots to
the VTK format and write them out.

[Usage:]

v = vtk(d)	        d = object containing atom coords (dump, data) :pre

v.one()                 write all snapshots to tmp.vtk
v.one("new")            write all snapshots to new.vtk
v.many()                write snapshots to tmp0000.vtk, tmp0001.vtk, etc
v.many("new")           write snapshots to new0000.vtk, new0001.vtk, etc
v.single(N)             write snapshot for timestep N to tmp.vtk 
v.single(N,"file")      write snapshot for timestep N to file.vtk :pre

  surfaces in snapshot will be written to SURF1.vtk, SURF2.vtk, etc
    where each surface (triangle type) is in a different file :pre

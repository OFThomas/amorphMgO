vec tool :h3

[Purpose:]

Read columns of numbers from a file.

[Description:]

The vtk tool converts atom snapshots in a LAMMPS dump file to the VTK
format used by various visualization packages.

The vtk constructor takes a Pizza.py object that stores atom snapshots
(e.g. dump or data).  Optionally, a file prefix for the VTK output
files can also be specified.  A ".vtk" suffix will be appended to all
output files.  The file prefix can also be specified by the file
setting.

The one(), many(), and single() methods convert specific snapshots to
VTK format and write them out.

[Usage:]

v = vec("file1")                    read in numeric vectors from a file :pre

  skip blank lines and lines that start with non-numeric characters
  assign names = "col1", "col2", etc :pre

nvec = v.nvec                       # of vectors
nlen = v.nlen		            lengths of vectors
names = v.names		            list of vector names
x,y,... = l.get(1,"col2",...)       return one or more vectors of values
l.write("file.txt")	            write all vectors to a file
l.write("file.txt","col1",7,...)    write listed vectors to a file :pre

  get and write allow abbreviated (uniquely) vector names or digits (1-Nvec) :pre
